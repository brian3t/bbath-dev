    <g:description>Made from incredibly soft, cuddly materials, Blooming Bath's petals hug any sink to create an adorable, safe, fun and convenient bath time experience for your most precious possession. Blooming Bath’s plush materials cradle and cushion your baby like no other baby tub can. Forget about those hard plastic baby bath tubs or baby bath seats that are uncomfortable and don't cradle your child during bath time. It’s a unique, easy, hassle-free experience that allows you to enjoy those special moments bathing your infant. Using and caring for Blooming Bath couldn’t be easier. Push it into your sink and it creates the perfect cushioned cradle to wash your baby. When you're finished, gently squeeze out the excess water and throw it in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. Or, if you prefer, just use the hang tag on the back — your Blooming Bath will be dry in no time. Incredibly Soft Safe And Durable Very Comfortable </g:description>
