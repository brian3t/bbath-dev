	<dt>What are the dimensions of the Blooming Bath?</dt>
		<dd>The Blooming Bath baby bath is 32 inches from tip to tip.  The center of the flower, where baby's bottom rests, is 10 inches across in diameter.</dd>
	<dt>What is the recommended age for the Blooming Bath?</dt>
		<dd>The Blooming Bath is ideal for newborns to 6 months. But because babies range so dramatically in size, there are no set age or weight limitations. The Blooming Bath is held up by the sides of the sink so it is more a matter of whether or not your sink can comfortably and safely accommodate your baby. Many parents also use Blooming Bath with traditional plastic tubs to create a plush, soft, safe and fun experience.</dd>
	<dt>Does the Blooming Bath hold water?</dt>
		<dd>The Blooming Bath does not hold water. You will need to first insert the stopper inside the drain, then fill up the sink to the desired level and desired temperature before inserting baby. Never run water directly on your baby as water temperature can change quickly.</dd>
	<dt>What materials are the Blooming Bath made with?</dt>
		<dd>Blooming Bath is made from a super soft, plush polyester material on the top, the center is a high quality polypropylene foam and the back is made from a durable polyester mesh back.</dd>

	<dt>Why is international shipping so expensive?</dt>
		<dd>We only ship via FedEx International to ensure your package arrives quickly and safely.

We will do our best to make sure the message is included inside the order before it ships.

	<dt>I am shipping the Blooming Bath as a gift.  Will the recipient see the price of the Blooming Bath?</dt>
